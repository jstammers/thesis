abstract = {We present a compact and stable dual-wavelength laser source for onboard atom interferometry with two different atomic species. It is based on frequency-doubled telecom lasers locked on a femtosecond optical frequency comb. We take advantage of the maturity of fiber telecom technology to reduce the number of free-space optical components, which are intrinsically less stable, and to make the setup immune to vibrations and thermal fluctuations. The source provides the frequency agility and phase stability required for atom interferometry and can easily be adapted to other cold atom experiments. We have shown its robustness by achieving the first dual-species K-Rb magneto-optical trap in microgravity during parabolic flights.},

abstract = {We present the complete characterization of a laser setup for rubidium cooling dedicated to space applications.

By frequency doubling two fiber laser diodes at 1560 nm, we produce the two optical frequencies at 780 nm required for atomic cooling of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Rb. The first laser is locked on saturated absorption signal and long term frequency drift has been canceled using a digital integrator. The optical frequency of the second laser is controlled relatively to the first one by a frequency comparison method. A full characterization of the setup, including frequency stability evaluation and frequency noise measurement has been performed. The optical frequency doubling module has been submitted to environmental tests to verify its compatibility with space applications.},

@article{Keshet2012,
abstract = {Atomic physics experiments often require a complex sequence of precisely timed computer controlled events. A distributed GUI-based control system designed with such experiments in mind, The Cicero Word Generator, is described. The system makes use of a client-server separation between a user interface for sequence design and a set of output hardware servers. Output hardware servers are designed to use standard National Instruments output cards, but the client-server nature allows this to be extended to other output hardware. Output sequences running on multiple servers and output cards can be synchronized using a shared clock. By using an FPGA-generated variable frequency clock, redundant buffers can be dramatically shortened, and a time resolution of 100ns achieved over effectively arbitrary sequence lengths.},

The general equations presented allow for an arbitrary modulation index and an arbitrary modulation frequency. We use this description for three purposes: First, we review the special cases of so-called frequency modulation and wavelength modulation spectroscopy. Second, we present the additional case of large-index, high-frequency modulation. Third, we present an overview of how the absorption signal depends on the experimental parameters of modulation frequency and modulation index. This overview may be helpful to experimentalists in choosing these parameters, for it provides a systematic understanding of how moving around in parameter space changes certain features of the signal, while leaving other features invariant.},

The underlying physics is purely two-dimensional cooling and trapping, which allows for a high flux of up to 6*10{\^{}}(10) atoms/s and a small divergence of the resulting beam. We analyze the velocity distribution of the 2D-MOT. The longitudinal velocity distribution of the atomic beam shows a broad feature(FWHM=75m/s), centered around 50m/s. The dependence of the flux on laser intensity, geometry of the trapping volume and on pressure in the vapor cell was investigated in detail. The influence of the geometry of the 2D-MOT on the mean velocity of the cold beam has been studied. We present a simple model for the velocity distribution of the flux based on rate equations describing the general dependencies.},

abstract = {We describe a new and highly effective optical frequency discriminator and laser stabilization system based on signals reflected from a stable Fabry-Perot reference interferometer. High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},
