abstract = {We analyze the influence of an arbitrarily directed uniform magnetic field on the laser sub-Doppler cooling of atoms. The analysis is done for a ͑3ϩ5͒-level atom excited by a ␴ ϩ -␴ Ϫ laser field configuration. Our analysis shows that the effects of the magnetic field depend strongly on the direction of the magnetic field. In an arbitrarily directed magnetic field the laser cooling configuration produces both the main resonance existing already at zero magnetic field and additional sub-Doppler resonances caused by two-photon and higher-order multiphoton processes. These sub-Doppler resonances are, however, well separated on the velocity scale if the Zeeman shift exceeds the widths of the resonances. This allows one to use the main sub-Doppler resonance for an effective laser cooling of atoms even in the presence of the magnetic field. The effective temperature of the atomic ensemble at the velocity of the main resonance is found to be almost the same as in the absence of the magnetic field. The defined structure of the multiphoton resonances may be of importance for the sub-Doppler laser cooling of atoms, atomic extraction from magneto-optical traps, and applications related to the control of atomic motion.},

abstract = {We present the complete characterization of a laser setup for rubidium cooling dedicated to space applications. The experimental setup is realized with commercial off-the-shelf fiber components suitable for space applications. By frequency doubling two fiber laser diodes at 1560 nm, we produce the two optical frequencies at 780 nm required for atomic cooling of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Rb. The first laser is locked on saturated absorption signal and long term frequency drift has been canceled using a digital integrator. The optical frequency of the second laser is controlled relatively to the first one by a frequency comparison method. A full characterization of the setup, including frequency stability evaluation and frequency noise measurement has been performed. The optical frequency doubling module has been submitted to environmental tests to verify its compatibility with space applications.},

abstract = {Quantum technology based on cold-atom interferometers is showing great promise for fields such as inertial sensing and fundamental physics. However, the best precision achievable on Earth is limited by the free-fall time of the atoms, and their full potential can only be realized in Space where interrogation times of many seconds will lead to unprecedented sensitivity. Various mission scenarios are presently being pursued which plan to implement matter-wave inertial sensors. Toward this goal, we realize the first onboard operation of simultaneous {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Rb {\$}-{\$} {\$}{\^{}}{\{}39{\}}{\$}K interferometers in the weightless environment produced during parabolic flight. The large vibration levels ({\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\~{}}g/\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashrm Hz{\}}{\$}), acceleration range ({\$}0-1.8{\~{}}g{\$}) and rotation rates ({\$}5{\$} deg/s) during flight present significant challenges. We demonstrate the capability of our dual-quantum sensor by measuring the E$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}tv$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}s parameter with systematic-limited uncertainties of {\$}1.1 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} and {\$}3.0 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} during standard- and micro-gravity, respectively. This constitutes the first test of the equivalence principle in a free-falling vehicle with quantum sensors. Our results are applicable to inertial navigation, and can be extended to the trajectory of a satellite for future Space missions.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors relying on atom interferometry offer a breakthrough advance in a variety of applications, such as inertial navigation, gravimetry or ground- and space-based tests of fundamental physics. These instruments require a quiet environment to reach their performance and using them outside the laboratory remains a challenge. Here we report the first operation of an airborne matter-wave accelerometer set up aboard a 0g plane and operating during the standard gravity (1g) and microgravity (0g) phases of the flight. At 1g, the sensor can detect inertial effects more than 300 times weaker than the typical acceleration fluctuations of the aircraft. We describe the improvement of the interferometer sensitivity in 0g, which reaches 2 x 10-4 ms-2 / √Hz with our current setup. We finally discuss the extension of our method to airborne and spaceborne tests of the Universality of free fall with matter waves.},

The underlying physics is purely two-dimensional cooling and trapping, which allows for a high flux of up to 6*10{\^{}}(10) atoms/s and a small divergence of the resulting beam. We analyze the velocity distribution of the 2D-MOT. The longitudinal velocity distribution of the atomic beam shows a broad feature(FWHM=75m/s), centered around 50m/s. The dependence of the flux on laser intensity, geometry of the trapping volume and on pressure in the vapor cell was investigated in detail. The influence of the geometry of the 2D-MOT on the mean velocity of the cold beam has been studied. We present a simple model for the velocity distribution of the flux based on rate equations describing the general dependencies.},

A distributed GUI-based control system designed with such experiments in mind, The Cicero Word Generator, is described. The system makes use of a client-server separation between a user interface for sequence design and a set of output hardware servers. Output hardware servers are designed to use standard National Instruments output cards, but the client-server nature allows this to be extended to other output hardware. Output sequences running on multiple servers and output cards can be synchronized using a shared clock. By using an FPGA-generated variable frequency clock, redundant buffers can be dramatically shortened, and a time resolution of 100ns achieved over effectively arbitrary sequence lengths.},

abstract = {The momentum diffusion coefficient, as a function of position and velocity, is discussed for two-state atoms travelling through a standing-wave laser field. Equations leading to the force and diffusion coefficient have been obtained by Minogin. The authors present an alternative derivation, based on moments of the Wigner function and give numerical solutions in terms of matrix continued fractions. In strong fields, the discussion is supplemented by a derivation of the diffusion coefficient within the dressed-atom basis, and a picture of the diffusion mechanism emerges which is quite different from the one at low intensities. Calculated forces and diffusion coefficients are used in a Fokker-Planck equation to obtain stationary atomic velocity distributions. Momentum diffusion of atoms moving in laser fields.

@article{Drever1983,
abstract = {We describe a new and highly effective optical frequency discriminator and laser stabilization system based on signals reflected from a stable Fabry-Perot reference interferometer. High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},

abstract = {It is shown that a three-level atom in the $\Lambda$ configuration with arbitrary detunings can be exactly reduced to a two-level system with an effective Raman coupling, which depends nonlinearly on the intensity of the two radiation fields. This is done by exactly evaluating the unitary transformation introduced by Alexanian and Bose [Phys. Rev. A 52, 2218 (1995)] for a three-level atom coupled to two modes of the radiation field. We obtain an exact transformed Hamiltonian in which one of the three levels is decoupled for all values of the detunings. In particular, our result is then valid for any ratios of the coupling constants to detunings, even for zero detuning, in contrast to earlier work which requires that these ratios be small. We find the the eigenvalues of the exact transformed Hamiltonian and study its population dynamics},

abstract = {In relation to the newly discovered laser cooling mechanisms, the authors have studied the momentum diffusion of an atom with a j (ground)-j+1 (excited) state transition (j not=0), interacting with two counterpropagating sigma +- sigma - plane waves. A correlation between successive photon absorptions via the multi-sublevel internal atomic structure leads to a large increase of the momentum diffusion coefficient. In a simple probabilistic picture this enhanced diffusion is interpreted as a random walk with effective steps much larger than the one-photon recoil momentum k. For j=1 the authors report the results of a complete calculation (i.e. with a quantum description of the internal atomic state) showing a marked dependence upon the velocity of the atom as well as on the parameters of the laser field (detuning and power).},

Second, we present the additional case of large-index, high-frequency modulation. Third, we present an overview of how the absorption signal depends on the experimental parameters of modulation frequency and modulation index. This overview may be helpful to experimentalists in choosing these parameters, for it provides a systematic understanding of how moving around in parameter space changes certain features of the signal, while leaving other features invariant.},
