abstract = {Inertial sensors relying on atom interferometry offer a breakthrough advance in a variety of applications, such as inertial navigation, gravimetry or ground- and space-based tests of fundamental physics. These instruments require a quiet environment to reach their performance and using them outside the laboratory remains a challenge. Here we report the first operation of an airborne matter-wave accelerometer set up aboard a 0g plane and operating during the standard gravity (1g) and microgravity (0g) phases of the flight. At 1g, the sensor can detect inertial effects more than 300 times weaker than the typical acceleration fluctuations of the aircraft. We describe the improvement of the interferometer sensitivity in 0g, which reaches 2 x 10-4 ms-2 / √Hz with our current setup. We finally discuss the extension of our method to airborne and spaceborne tests of the Universality of free fall with matter waves.},

abstract = {The momentum diffusion coefficient, as a function of position and velocity, is discussed for two-state atoms travelling through a standing-wave laser field. Equations leading to the force and diffusion coefficient have been obtained by Minogin. The authors present an alternative derivation, based on moments of the Wigner function and give numerical solutions in terms of matrix continued fractions. In strong fields, the discussion is supplemented by a derivation of the diffusion coefficient within the dressed-atom basis, and a picture of the diffusion mechanism emerges which is quite different from the one at low intensities. Calculated forces and diffusion coefficients are used in a Fokker-Planck equation to obtain stationary atomic velocity distributions. Momentum diffusion of atoms moving in laser fields.

abstract = {We present here an analysis of the sensitivity of a time-domain atomic interferometer to the phase noise of the lasers used to manipulate the atomic wave packets. The sensitivity function is calculated in the case of a three-pulse Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which is the configuration of the two inertial sensors we are building at the Laboratoire National de Metrologie et d'Essais-Systeme de References Temps-Espace. We successfully compare this calculation to experimental measurements. The sensitivity of the interferometer is limited by the phase noise of the lasers as well as by residual vibrations. We evaluate the performance that could be obtained with state-of-the-art quartz oscillators, as well as the impact of the residual phase noise of the phase-locked loop. Requirements on the level of vibrations are derived from the same formalism.},

abstract = {We present the realization of a compact micro-wave frequency synthesizer for an atom interferometer based on stimulated Raman transitions, applied to transportable inertial sensing. Our set-up is intended to address the hyperfine transitions of Rubidium 87 atoms at 6.8 GHz. The prototype is evaluated both in the time and the frequency domain by comparison with state-of-the-art frequency references developed at LNE-SYRTE. In free-running mode, it features a residual phase noise level of -65 dBrad{\$}{\^{}}2.Hz{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} at 10-Hz offset frequency and a white phase noise level in the order of -120 dBrad{\^{}}2.Hz{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} for Fourier frequencies above 10 kHz. The phase noise effect on the sensitivity of the atomic interferometer is evaluated for diverse values of cycling time, interrogation time and Raman pulse duration. To our knowledge, the resulting contribution is well below the sensitivity of any demonstrated cold atom inertial sensors based on stimulated Raman transitions. The drastic improvement in terms of size, simplicity and power consumption paves the way towards field and mobile operations.},

The joint operation enables for a faster averaging of the Dick effect associated with the local oscillator noise in clocks and with vibration noise in cold atom inertial sensors. Such an operation allows achieving the lowest stability limit due to atom shot noise. We demonstrate a multiple joint operation in which up to five clouds of atoms are interrogated simultaneously in a single setup. The essential feature of multiple joint operation, demonstrated here for a micro-wave Ramsey interrogation, can be generalized to go beyond the current stability limit associated with dead times in present-day cold atom interferometer inertial sensors.},

abstract = {We show that the language of atom interferometry provides a unified picture for microwave and optical atomic clocks as well as for gravito-inertial sensors. The sensitivity and accuracy of these devices is now such that a new theoretical framework common to all these interferometers is required that includes: (a) a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic motion in free space and in the presence of a gravitational field (most cold-atom interferometric devices use atoms in �free fall� in a fountain geometry); (b) an account of simultaneous actions of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the interaction zones; (c) a second quantization of the matter fields to take into account their fermionic or bosonic character in order to discuss the role of coherent sources and their noise properties; (d) a covariant treatment including spin to evaluate general relativistic effects. A theoretical description of atomic clocks revisited along these lines is presented, using both an exact propagator of atom waves in gravito-inertial fields and a covariant Dirac equation in the presence of weak gravitational fields. Using this framework, recoil effects, spin-related effects, beam curvature effects, the sensitivity to gravito-inertial fields and the influence of the coherence of the atom source are discussed in the context of present and future atomic clocks and gravito-inertial sensors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a brief overview of atom interferometry. This field of research has developed very rapidly since 1991. Atom and light wave interferometers present some similarities but there are very important differences in the tools used to manipulate these two types of waves. Moreover, the sensitivity of atomic waves and light waves to their environment is very different. Atom interferometry has already been used for a large variety of studies: measurements of atomic properties and of inertial effects (accelerations and rotations), new access to some fundamental constants, observation of quantum decoherence, etc. We review the techniques used for a coherent manipulation of atomic waves and the main applications of atom interferometers.},

The first laser is locked on saturated absorption signal and long term frequency drift has been canceled using a digital integrator. The optical frequency of the second laser is controlled relatively to the first one by a frequency comparison method.

The optical frequency doubling module has been submitted to environmental tests to verify its compatibility with space applications.},

Our method can be used to reduce the uncertainty in atomic gravimeters by one order of magnitude, resulting in an error of {\textless}3 × 10−10g, and it is suitable in a wide variety of atom interferometers with thermal or ultracold atoms.

abstract = {We describe a new and highly effective optical frequency discriminator and laser stabilization system based on signals reflected from a stable Fabry-Perot reference interferometer. High sensitivity for detection of resonance information is achieved by optical heterodyne detection with sidebands produced by rf phase modulation. Physical, optical, and electronic aspects of this discriminator/laser frequency stabilization system are considered in detail. We show that a high-speed domain exists in which the system responds to the phase (rather than frequency) change of the laser; thus with suitable design the servo loop bandwidth is not limited by the cavity response time. We report diagnostic experiments in which a dye laser and gas laser were independently locked to one stable cavity. Because of the precautions employed, the observed sub-100 Hz beat line width shows that the lasers were this stable. Applications of this system of laser stabilization include precision laser spectroscopy and interferometric gravity-wave detectors.},

abstract = {It is shown that a three-level atom in the $\Lambda$ configuration with arbitrary detunings can be exactly reduced to a two-level system with an effective Raman coupling, which depends nonlinearly on the intensity of the two radiation fields. This is done by exactly evaluating the unitary transformation introduced by Alexanian and Bose [Phys. Rev. A 52, 2218 (1995)] for a three-level atom coupled to two modes of the radiation field. We obtain an exact transformed Hamiltonian in which one of the three levels is decoupled for all values of the detunings. In particular, our result is then valid for any ratios of the coupling constants to detunings, even for zero detuning, in contrast to earlier work which requires that these ratios be small. We find the the eigenvalues of the exact transformed Hamiltonian and study its population dynamics},

Output hardware servers are designed to use standard National Instruments output cards, but the client-server nature allows this to be extended to other output hardware. Output sequences running on multiple servers and output cards can be synchronized using a shared clock. By using an FPGA-generated variable frequency clock, redundant buffers can be dramatically shortened, and a time resolution of 100ns achieved over effectively arbitrary sequence lengths.},

We analyze the velocity distribution of the 2D-MOT. The longitudinal velocity distribution of the atomic beam shows a broad feature(FWHM=75m/s), centered around 50m/s. The dependence of the flux on laser intensity, geometry of the trapping volume and on pressure in the vapor cell was investigated in detail. The influence of the geometry of the 2D-MOT on the mean velocity of the cold beam has been studied.

abstract = {Driven Raman processes --- nearly resonant two-photon transitions through an intermediate state that is non-resonantly coupled and does not acquire a sizeable population --- are commonly treated with a simplified description in which the intermediate state is removed by adiabatic elimination. While the adiabatic-elimination approximation is reliable when the detuning of the intermediate state is quite large, it cannot be trusted in other situations, and it does not allow one to estimate the population in the eliminated state. We introduce an alternative method that keeps all states in the description, without increasing the complexity by much. An integro-differential equation of Lippmann-Schwinger type generates a hierarchy of approximations, but very accurate results are already obtained in the lowest order.},

abstract = {In relation to the newly discovered laser cooling mechanisms, the authors have studied the momentum diffusion of an atom with a j (ground)-j+1 (excited) state transition (j not=0), interacting with two counterpropagating sigma +- sigma - plane waves. A correlation between successive photon absorptions via the multi-sublevel internal atomic structure leads to a large increase of the momentum diffusion coefficient. In a simple probabilistic picture this enhanced diffusion is interpreted as a random walk with effective steps much larger than the one-photon recoil momentum k. For j=1 the authors report the results of a complete calculation (i.e. with a quantum description of the internal atomic state) showing a marked dependence upon the velocity of the atom as well as on the parameters of the laser field (detuning and power).},

abstract = {We analyze the influence of an arbitrarily directed uniform magnetic field on the laser sub-Doppler cooling of atoms. The analysis is done for a ͑3ϩ5͒-level atom excited by a ␴ ϩ -␴ Ϫ laser field configuration. Our analysis shows that the effects of the magnetic field depend strongly on the direction of the magnetic field. In an arbitrarily directed magnetic field the laser cooling configuration produces both the main resonance existing already at zero magnetic field and additional sub-Doppler resonances caused by two-photon and higher-order multiphoton processes. These sub-Doppler resonances are, however, well separated on the velocity scale if the Zeeman shift exceeds the widths of the resonances. This allows one to use the main sub-Doppler resonance for an effective laser cooling of atoms even in the presence of the magnetic field. The effective temperature of the atomic ensemble at the velocity of the main resonance is found to be almost the same as in the absence of the magnetic field. The defined structure of the multiphoton resonances may be of importance for the sub-Doppler laser cooling of atoms, atomic extraction from magneto-optical traps, and applications related to the control of atomic motion.},

Second, we present the additional case of large-index, high-frequency modulation. Third, we present an overview of how the absorption signal depends on the experimental parameters of modulation frequency and modulation index. This overview may be helpful to experimentalists in choosing these parameters, for it provides a systematic understanding of how moving around in parameter space changes certain features of the signal, while leaving other features invariant.},

abstract = {Quantum technology based on cold-atom interferometers is showing great promise for fields such as inertial sensing and fundamental physics. However, the best precision achievable on Earth is limited by the free-fall time of the atoms, and their full potential can only be realized in Space where interrogation times of many seconds will lead to unprecedented sensitivity. Various mission scenarios are presently being pursued which plan to implement matter-wave inertial sensors. Toward this goal, we realize the first onboard operation of simultaneous {\$}{\^{}}{\{}87{\}}{\$}Rb {\$}-{\$} {\$}{\^{}}{\{}39{\}}{\$}K interferometers in the weightless environment produced during parabolic flight. The large vibration levels ({\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\~{}}g/\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashrm Hz{\}}{\$}), acceleration range ({\$}0-1.8{\~{}}g{\$}) and rotation rates ({\$}5{\$} deg/s) during flight present significant challenges.

The system consists of three external-cavity diode lasers operating around 795 nm. A low-power laser serves as a frequency reference for two high-power lasers which are phased locked with an optical phase-locked loop. We measured the residual phase noise of the system to be less than 0.04 rad(2). In order to show the application of the system towards atomic coherence experiments, we used it to implement electromagnetically induced transparency in a rubidium vapor cell and obtained a reduction in the absorption coefficient of 92{\%}.},

@article{Fang2016,
abstract = {Developments in atom interferometry have led to atomic inertial sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Their performances are for the moment limited by the ground vibrations, the impact of which is exacerbated by the sequential operation, resulting in aliasing and dead time. We discuss several experiments performed at LNE-SYRTE in order to reduce these problems and achieve the intrinsic limit of atomic inertial sensors. These techniques have resulted in transportable and high-performance instruments that participate in gravity measurements, and pave the way to applications in inertial navigation.},

abstract = {We report the direct comparison between the stabilities of two mobile absolute gravimeters of different technology: the LNE-SYRTE Cold Atom Gravimeter and FG5X$\backslash${\#}216 of the Universit$\backslash$'e du Luxembourg. These instruments rely on two different principles of operation: atomic and optical interferometry. The comparison took place in the Walferdange Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics in Luxembourg, at the beginning of the last International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters, ICAG-2013. We analyse a 2h10 duration common measurement, and find that the CAG shows better immunity with respect to changes in the level of vibration noise, as well as a slightly better short term stability.},
