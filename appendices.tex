% \chapter{Laser Systems}\label{chap:setup}
% This chapter provides a description of the hardware that makes up the experiment. Over the course of the project, the complexity of the experiment necessarily increased. The setup is presented in a bottom-up approach, starting from the most fundamental components, to provide a clear overview of the system. \\

% \section{Chapter Overview}\label{sec:setup_overview}
% The first two sections describe the two commercial laser systems used in this experiment. The \Muquans\ laser system which generates the light used for cooling and repump in the 2D and 3D \acp{mots}, referred to as the \acs{mot} light. The design and operation of this laser is given in \SectionRef{sec:setup_muquans}. A secondary laser system, built by MSquared, is used to generate light to drive Raman transitions between two hyperfine ground states in \ac{rb87}\footnote{The \Muquans\ laser also has a pair of lasers designed for driving Raman transitions, but these are not used in this experiment. \SectionRef{sec:setup_msquared} gives an explanation for this.}, otherwise referred to as Raman light. This is described in \SectionRef{sec:setup_msquared}.This is followed by a description of the vacuum chamber in \SectionRef{sec:setup_chamber} which contains both the 2D \ac{mot} (\SectionRef{subsec:setup_2DMOT}) and the 3D \ac{mot} (\SectionRef{subsec:setup_3DMOT}).
