\chapter{Preparing Atoms for Interferometry}\label{chap:atom_prep}
This chapter presents the work that went towards the initial stages of the experimental sequence, where the main objective is to prepare a sufficiently cold ensemble of \ac{rb87} in the same quantum state.
\section{Chapter Outline}
\verysubsection{To-Do}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss loading atoms in 3D MOT from 2D
    \item Characterisation of the moving frame optical molasses
    \item Various schemes for preparing atoms into \(\ket{1,0}\). {\textit mention velocity selection here or in next chapter?}
\end{itemize}
