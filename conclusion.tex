\chapter{Outlook}
This final chapter describes some of the next steps and further work
\section{Combining with classical accelerometers}\label{sec:outlook_combsensors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss schemes for combining multiple sensors - Kalman filtering
    \item Extend this to inertial navigation
    \item Steps towards overcoming sensitivity-bandwidth trade-off. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Extending to senstivity along three axes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item New chamber design
    \item Improvements to MSquared laser
    \item Required knowledge of gravitational axis for accurate navigation
\end{itemize}
