\chapter{Acceleration-Sensitive Interference}\label{chap:atom_int}

\section{Chapter Outline}
This chapter describes the aspects of the project aimed at observing
matter-wave interference in \ac{rb87} and its subsequent
characterisation. The laser system used to drive the necessary Raman
transitions is presented in~\SectionRef{sec:msquared_laser}. This is
followed by a discussion of the methods used to detect the population
in each internal state in~\SectionRef{sec:atom_detection}. The Raman
transition spectrum and
dynamics of the atoms during each Raman pulse are discussed
in~\SectionRef{sec:pulse_characterisation}. This chapter continues
with an overview of indentified sources of noise and their impact on
the interferometer's sensitivity to accelerations
in~\SectionRef{sec:atomint_sensitivity}. Finally, a presentation of observed
interference and an analysis of its sensitivity to accelerations is
given in~\SectionRef{sec:atomint_accelerations}.
\section{The M-Squared Laser System}\label{sec:msquared_laser} 
  This section describes the laser system manufactured by \textit{M-Squared
  Lasers}, which is used to drive Raman transitions. An overview of the laser
  system can be found in~\SectionRef{subsec:msquared_overview}, which includes
  the techniques used to externally communicate with the laser's ICE-BLOC
  control modules. The control of the frequency and phase-lock is then described
  in~\SectionRef{subsec:msquared_control}. Finally, this section concludes
  in~\SectionRef{subsec:dcs_module} with a description of the DCS
  module which is used to control
  the amplitude, frequency and phase of the Raman laser beat-note
  during the experiment.
\subsection{Laser System Overview}
\label{subsec:msquared_overview} The Raman laser system contains two Solstis lasers which
generate laser light by pumping a Ti-sapphire crystal housed inside a resonator.
The output light is frequency-stabilised using piezo-electric stacks to adjust
the resonator length~\cite{Drever1983}. A schematic diagram of this laser system is given
in~\FigureRef{fig:msquared_laser}. Each laser is seeded using a
\textit{Lighthouse Photonics} Sprout laser to generate light around
\sivalue{780}{\nano\metre}. The first laser acts as the master whose frequency
is fixed to an absorption feature in the transition spectrum of
\ac{rb87}. The second is slaved to this using a phase-locked loop to keep their
beat frequency and relative phase constant. The two beams are mixed on a
\ac{pbs}, so that they are orthogonally polarised. Two \acp{aom} control the
output power. 
%A planned upgrade for this system will have multiple output ports
%for the Raman light, which will require independent control. 
\par\noindent 
The system contains 4 ICE-BLOC modules which implement various types of control. The
first two (one for each Solstis) are used to stabilise the output power of each
laser by feeding back to the corresponding Sprout laser. They are also used to
coarsely adjust the output frequency, which is measured using a
\textit{HighFinesse} wavemeter. The third is used for the \ac{pll}
and feeds-back onto the slave laser to control both the frequency and phase of
the optical beat-note between the two lasers. The final ICE-BLOC, referred to
as the DCS module, is used to control the lasers in real-time during the
experiment.

		the power, frequency and phase as required to drive Raman transitions is
		handled by the four ICE-BLOC modules indicated in blue. Further detail of
		this control is given in the text.} \label{fig:msquared_laser}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{External ICE-BLOC Control}
The ICE-BLOC modules are able to communicate with each other using an Ethernet
hub. Another computer connected to this network is able to control them by
accessing a web page that each module hosts. These web pages control the ICE-BLOCs
by sending structured JSON messages. This graphical interface can be bypassed by
directly communicating these messages. This is done using MOTMaster so that
various parameters, such as the frequency and phase of the Raman beat-note, can
be automatically varied between each experiment cycle. 
\subsection{Frequency and Phase Control}\label{subsec:msquared_control}

\subsubsection{Master Lock}
The frequency of the master laser is stabilised using saturated absorption
spectroscopy in a Rubidium vapour cell. Part of the beam is picked off and
modulated by an \ac{eom}. The positive frequency sideband is used to lock the
master laser to the 2,3 crossover feature. In effect, this means that the
modulation frequency of the \ac{eom} sets the one-photon detuning of the Raman
transition. The modulation frequency is set so that the master laser frequency
is \sivalue{1.13}{\giga\hertz} below the \trans{2}{3} transition.

\subsubsection{Frequency and Phase Lock} The optical beat-note between the two
lasers is measured using a fast photodiode. The signal from this is used in a
\ac{pll} to fix the relative phase between the two lasers. A frequency
divider halves the frequency of the signal before comparing it to a \ac{vco} of
around \sivalue{3.4}{\giga\hertz}. This creates an error signal which used to
control both the frequency and phase of the beat-note by feeding back to the
slave laser Solstis. The relative phase between the two lasers is adjusted using
an analogue phase shifter and the frequency difference is controlled by tuning
the \ac{vco} frequency. \par\noindent The beat-frequency of the Raman lasers can
be chirped by triggering a ramp of the control voltage to the \ac{vco}. For
chirp rates of lower than \sivalue{24}{\mega\hertz\per\second}, the phase-lock
is able to keep the beat-note phase-coherent during the chirp.  
\subsection{The DCS Module}\label{subsec:dcs_module} 
The DCS module is used to control the
output of the lasers during the experiment. It uses an on-board
\ac{dds} to
synthesise the \sivalue{80}{\mega\hertz} driving frequencies for each \ac{aom}.
The majority of the control is done using an \ac{fpga} that synthesises a timed
sequence of analogue and digital voltage waveforms. An example of a sequence
created using the DCS web interface is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:dcs_module}. The
sequence is segmented into individual steps and each channel can be separately
configured, much like the MOTMaster user interface. \par\noindent This module is
used to control the amplitude, frequency and phase of each Raman pulse. The
pulse amplitude is shaped using an analogue voltage to control the power of the
RF frequency. The voltage output has been calibrated so that the pulse can be shaped to
produce a square, Gaussian or Blackman amplitude envelope. A frequency
chirp of the beat-note is
optionally triggered by sending a digital pulse to the \ac{pll} ICE-BLOC.
\par\noindent The synthesiser can be configured to run continuously, or to wait
at a chosen timestep for an external trigger. It can also iterate through a set
number of parameters, such as timestep duration or phase shift by re-building
the sequence after each cycle.

\section{Atom Detection}\label{sec:atom_detection} 
This section describes the methods used to
measure the number of atoms in each hyperfine ground state and infer
the interferometer phase. It begins with a
presentation the optical setup used to collect fluorescent light on a
photodiode in~\SectionRef{subsec:optical_setup}.
The scheme used to detect the atoms by
driving \(\sigma^+\) transitions is then described in~\SectionRef{subsec:optical_setup}.
This concludes with a
discussion on converting the measured photodiode signals into atom
number and interferometer phase
in~\SectionRef{subsec:phase_measurement}.
\subsection{Optical Setup}\label{subsec:optical_setup}
A precise measurement of the number of atoms requires that the atom shot noise
is the dominant source of uncertainty. The CCD used in
previous stages of the experiment is not sensitive enough for this as there is a
significant amount of noise in reading out the charge collected at each pixel.
Instead, a more sensitive photodiode is used to detect the atoms. With a
suitably high bandwidth, the readout time is much faster than the CCD as well,
so that the atoms can be detected well before they fall out of the field of
view. \par\noindent A diagram of the setup used to detect the atoms is given
in~\FigureRef{fig:photodiode_optics}. It is a triplet system which uses an
lenses with focal lengths \sivalue{150}{\milli\metre},
\sivalue{75}{\milli\metre} and \sivalue{60}{\milli\metre} in order from the
atoms to the photodiode.  A ray-tracing simulation of the optical
system indicates spherical aberrations on the image. This is caused by
the third lens, which was added to shorten the back focal length. The
front lens has a diameter of
\sivalue{50.4}{\milli\metre}, so the solid angle subtended by the
optics is \(4\pi \times\)\num{7.056e-3}\si{\steradian}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp] 
  \centering \fontsize{18pt}{18pt}
	\resizebox{0.7\textwidth}{!}{\input{photodiode_optics.pdf_tex}}
	\caption[Optical setup for Photodiode Detection]{Optical setup for photodiode
		detection. A triplet lens system focuses light from radiated from the atoms
		onto a photodiode. This is mounted using a translation stage to
  position the photodiode at the back focal point.}
  \label{fig:photodiode_optics}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Photodiode Calibration}
The photodiode used is a \textit{Femto LCA-S-400K-SI},
which has a trans-impedance amplifier with a bandwidth of \sivalue{400}{\kilo\hertz} and a photo-sensitive area
with a diameter of \sivalue{3}{\milli\metre}. This
gives a conversion factor of \sivalue{1.84e6}{\volt\per\watt}.
\subsection{Detection using \(\sigma^+\) transitions}\label{subsec:photodiode_setup}
The atoms are detected using resonance fluorescence from the two
vertically aligned \ac{mot} beams. A bias field polarises the atoms
along the
\(\vec{z}\) axis, so the light drives both \(\sigma^+\) and
\(\sigma^-\)
transitions. The Zeeman shift means that each magnetic sub-level has a different scattering rate, which
must be accounted for to calculate the number of atoms. This can be
simplified by inverting the handedness of
one of the \(\vec{z}\) \ac{mot} beams using a liquid-crystal
\ac{hwp}. Now, both beams drive \(\sigma^+\) transitions. The
atoms are optically pumped into \(\ket{2,2}\) and cycle on the
\(\ket{2,2} \rightarrow \ket{3,3}\) transition. Therefore, only one
scattering rate is needed to calculate the number of atoms. 
\par\noindent
\FigureRef{fig:detection_scheme} shows the setup used to invert the
polarisation of one \ac{mot} beam prior to detection. The liquid-crystal
waveplate is an electro-optical device whose birefringence changes
when an ac voltage is applied across it. The waveplate is placed at
the output of the downward-propagating (\(\vec{z}_-\))
collimator. The liquid-crystal waveplate is triggered to rotate the
incoming linearly polarised light by $\pi/2$\sivalue{}{\radian}. 
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \centering
    \fontsize{14pt}{14pt}
    \resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{\input{detection_scheme.pdf_tex}}
    \caption[Scheme to invert beam polarisation.]{Scheme to invert
      beam polarisation. In the \ac{mot} loading phase of the
      experiment, the liquid crystal \ac{hwp} is oriented to give a
      right-hand circular polarised beam shown in blue. Prior to
      detection, a digital pulse triggers a re-orientation of its slow
      axis. This results in a left-hand circular polarised beam, shown
      in red.}\label{fig:detection_scheme}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Detection Sequence}\label{subsec:detection_sequence}
The sequence used to detect the atoms is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:detection}. Shortly before the sequence starts, the
bias field is aligned to the \(\vec{z}\) axis and the liquid-crystal
waveplate is triggered to change the handedness of the \(\vec{z}_-\)
beam. The cooling laser frequency is set so it is detuned by
\(\delta_D =\) \sivalue{3}{\mega\hertz}
below the \trans{2}{3} transition and the repump laser is set to
resonance with the \trans{1}{2} transition. This creates an optical
molasses which avoids heating the atoms so that they remain in the
detection volume for a longer period of time. The intensity of the
light is reduced to around \(3 I_\text{sat}\). As shown below, this
intensity was empirically found to minimise the variance in output
voltage. The acquisition of the photodiode voltage is
triggered to start at the first Dwell time. The cooling light is first
switched on, so that only atoms in \(\ket{F=2}\) scatter light. After this, the repump
is switched on, so that atoms in \(\ket{F=1}\) are optically pumped
into \(\ket{F=2}\) and all the atoms scatter light. This repump light is a
sideband of the cooling laser, so the total output is increased
to ensure that the intensity of the cooling light remains constant.
Each detection step lasts \sivalue{250}{\micro\second}, but the
first \sivalue{50}{\micro\second} is discarded to allow time for the
intensity to stabilise and for optical pumping into \(\ket{F=2}\).
The atoms are then blown away by switching off one of the detection
beams before the sequence is repeated to collect a
background signal.

  \resizebox{0.8\textwidth}{!}{\input{detection.pdf_tex}} 
  \caption[State detection sequence timing]{Timing diagram for state
  detection. Atoms in \(\ket{F=2}\) are detected before the repump
light pumps those in \(\ket{F=1}\), so they are detected as well. A
background light measurement for each step is also taken.}
	\label{fig:detection} 
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Maximum Detection Time}\label{subsubsec:intensity_dependendce}
As the atoms scatter light during detection, the cloud will be heated
and expand due to the momentum exchanged from absorption and
spontaneous emission. The atoms are only cooled along the axis of the
detection beams, so the heating rate is greatest along the other two
axes. It is necessary to ensure that the
heating rate is low enough that the atoms remain within the
detection beam for the entire detection time. A requirement on the
maximum detection time can be obtained as follows. The momentum of
an atom scattering photons follows a random walk, so the variance of
the momentum along one axis after a time \(t\) is
\(\langle\Delta p\rangle^2 = 2 D t\). The scattered photon is equally
likely to be emitted in any direction, so the diffusion coefficient is
\begin{equation}
  D = \frac{1}{3}(\hbar k)^2 R_\text{sc}
  \label{eq:diffusion_coeff}
\end{equation}
If the cloud has a
Gaussian spatial distribution with an
initial width of \(\sigma_0\), the width at a later time of
is given by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_x^2(t) = \sigma_0^2 + \frac{2 n_p v_r^2 t^2}{3} 
  \label{eq:width_scattering}
\end{equation}
where \(v_r = \frac{\hbar k}{m_\text{rb}} =
\) \sivalue{6}{\milli\metre\per\second} is the recoil velocity and \(n_p\) is the
number of photons scattered. To remain within the detection region,
the width of the cloud must be smaller than the detection beam waist
\(w\), so the detection time must satisfy
\begin{equation}
  t_D \ll \sqrt{\frac{3 \left(w^2-\sigma_0^2\right)}{2 \left(n
  v_r^2\right)}}
  \label{eq:detection_time}
\end{equation}
For a beam waist of \sivalue{7.5}{\milli\metre}, initial cloud size of
\sivalue{5}{\milli\metre} and a maximum scattering rate of
\sivalue{2e7}{\per\second} the detection time must be much less than
\sivalue{4.7}{\milli\second}. 
%\begin{equation}
%  p(x,t) = \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} e^{-\frac{(x + \frac{p}{m}
%    t)^2}}{2 \sigma_x^2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi D t} e^{-\frac{p^2}{2 D
%      t}} \mathrm{d}t
%  \label{eq:prob_atom_diff}
%\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Optimal Intensity}
The optimal intensity was empirically found by varying the total power
in the detection beams and recording the photodiode voltage for a
fixed detection time of \sivalue{200}{\micro\second}.
\FigureRef{fig:photodiode_intensity_calib} the average voltage
measured by detecting atoms in the \(\ket{F=2}\) state as the
intensity of the light increases. The saturation parameter \(s\) is
defined using the peak intensity and by the time they are detected,
the atoms have moved from this region. A non-linear least squares fit
to the function
\begin{equation}
  v = a\frac{b s}{1 + b s + 4 \left(\delta_D/\Gamma\right)^2}
  \label{eq:voltage_fit}
\end{equation}
gives a scaling for the intensity of \(b = 0.83\). The variance in the
measured voltage (for a constant mean number of atoms) is minimised when the
intensity is around 3\(I_\text{sat}\). Above this intensity, there is
a significant depopulation into \(\ket{F=1}\) caused by off-resonant
excitations to the \(\ket{F'=2}\) state.
This is evident in the voltage signal over time, which is
shown in \FigureRef{fig:detection_time} for various intensities. At an
intensity of 3\(I_\text{sat}\), around 5\% of the population is
pumped out of \(\ket{F=2}\).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measuring the Occupation Probability}\label{subsec:phase_measurement}

The occupation probability of the $\ket{F=2}$ state is obtained by measuring the proportion of
atoms in each hyperfine ground state. The number of atoms
\(n_\text{at}\) that scatter light on the cycling transition is
proportional to the photodiode voltage \(U_\text{pd}\) as follows
\begin{equation}
  U_\textnormal{pd} &= \eta R_\text{sc}(I,\Delta) n_\text{at} \hbar \omega G \nonumber \\
  &= \alpha \eta R_\text{sc}(I, \Delta) n_\text{at}
  \label{eq:pd_signal}
\end{equation}
where \(\eta = \Omega/4\pi\) is the fractional solid angle subtended by the
collection optics, \(\hbar\omega = \sivalue{1.6}{\electronvolt}\) is
the photon energy, \(R_\text{sc}\) is the scattering rate defined
in~\EquationRef{eq:scattering_rate} and \(G\) is the photodiode
conversion gain. At the saturation intensity and a detuning of
\sivalue{3}{\mega\hertz}, the voltage measured per
atom is around \sivalue{30}{\nano\volt} per atom. The probability of
an atom occupying \(\ket{F=2}\) is estimated as follows
\begin{equation}
  \text{P}_{\ket{F=2}} =
  \frac{\text{N}_2-\text{B}_2}{\text{N}_\text{Tot} -
  \text{B}_\text{Tot}}
  \label{eq:prob_measurement}
\end{equation}
where N and B denote the average voltage during signal and background measurements,
respectively. Subtracting the background signal from each measurement
removes the bias that arises from detecting light not
scattered by the atoms.
The interferometer phase \(\Phi\) is determined from \EquationRef{eq:prob_measurement} using
\begin{equation}
\text{P}_{\ket{F=2}} = \text{P}_0+\frac{C}{2}\cos(\Phi)
  \label{eq:interferometer_phase}
\end{equation}
where P\(_0\) is the mean probability of detecting atoms in
\(\ket{F=2}\) and \(C\) is the interferometer fringe contrast. These
are experimentally determined by varying $\Phi$ as described
in~\SectionRef{sec:fringe_cal}.

\subsubsection{Atom Number Bias}\label{subsec:atom_number_bias}
If is worth describing the voltages measured by the photodiode in more
detail.
The expression for the population in~\EquationRef{eq:prob_measurement} assumes that the voltage measured in
the N\(_2\) and N\(_\text{Tot}\) detection steps are directly
proportional to the number of atoms present in \(\ket{F=2}\) and the
total number in the interferometer, respectively. In actual fact,
there is a bias in N\(_2\) from the previously mentioned de-population
and a bias in N\(_\text{Tot}\) from a residual population in the
\(\ket{F=1,m_F=\pm 1}\) states. These contribute to an error in
P\(_{\ket{F=2}}\), which reduces the maximum population that can be
detected in \(\ket{F=2}\). This causes a reduction in the
interferometer fringe contrast and hence, sensitivity. In the
following discussion, these systematic errors are addressed emphasise
their effect. It is shown that for an increasing fraction of
atoms in the $\ket{1,\pm 1}$ states, this dominates over the
depopulation from the $\ket{F=2}$ level.
\par\noindent
If atoms are pumped out of
\(\ket{F=2}\) at a rate \(\gamma\), then the number of atoms in the
number of atoms in both hyperfine ground states is given by
\begin{equation}
  n_2(t) = n^i_2e^{-\gamma t}
  \label{eq:n2_time}
\end{equation}
where \(n^i_2\) is the initial number in \(\ket{F=2}\). After
averaging over a time \(\tau\), this gives
\begin{equation}
  \bar{n}_2 = \frac{n^i_2 (1-e^{-\gamma \tau})}{\gamma \tau}
  \label{eq:n2_avg}
\end{equation}
Consequently, the number of atoms in \(\ket{F=1}\) increases. This is
expressed as
\begin{equation}
\bar{n}_1 = n_1^i + (1-e^{-\gamma \tau})n_2^i + n_{\pm 1}
  \label{eq:n1_avg}
\end{equation}
where \(n_{\pm 1}\) is the background population in \(\ket{1,\pm{1}}\). The bias
is the occupation probability is then
\begin{equation}
\delta P =  \frac{\bar{n}_2}{\bar{n}_2 + \bar{n}_1} - \frac{n^i_2}{n_1^i + n_2^i}
  \label{eq:prob_bias}
\end{equation}
This bias has the effect of reducing the interferometer contrast.
The residual atoms in m\(_F = \pm 1\) and the depopulation
means it is not possible to ever detect the total
population in \(\ket{F=2}\). The contrast is given by
\begin{align}
  C &=  P_\text{max} - P_\text{min} \nonumber \\
  & = 1 - \frac{(1-e^{-\gamma \tau})}{1-\alpha}
  \label{eq:contrast}
\end{align}
where \(\alpha = \frac{n_{\pm{1}}}{n_1+n_2}\) is the ratio of the
number of residual
atoms to the number in the interferometer.
A plot of the contrast for an increasing
proportion of m\(_F = \pm 1\) atoms is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:contrast_bias}, taking the loss rate of the
photodiode signal
measured in~\FigureRef{fig:detection_time} for \(s = 3\). For an
m\(_F=\pm 1\) population of at least
4\% of that in m\(_F = 0\), the reduction in contrast is dominated by
the residual atoms.

number dominates over the depopulation.}

\section{Individual Pulse Characterisation} \label{sec:atomint_rabiosc}
This section presents a characterisation of the pulses used to drive
Raman transitions between the two hyperfine ground states. First, the
properties of the Raman transition spectrum are presented
in~\SectionRef{subsec:raman_spec}. Following this, a discussion of
cancelling the systematic phase from a differential ac Stark Shift is
given in~\SectionRef{subsec:light_shift}. Finally, this section
concludes with specific details about the individual pulses used in
the experiment. The first Raman pulse, which is used to select a
subset of atoms with a narrow velocity spread, is presented
in~\SectionRef{subsec:vel_select}. This section concludes with a presentation
of the dynamics of the three pulses used to coherently control the
atoms during the interferometer in~\SectionRef{subsec:int_pulses}
\subsection{Raman Transition Spectrum}\label{subsec:raman_spec}

The state preparation sequence optically pumps the majority of the atoms 
into the \(\ket{1,0}\) state. Ideally, each
Raman beam is perfectly circularly polarised and can only drive
\(\ket{1,0}\leftrightarrow\ket{2,0}\) transitions using either of the
counter-propagating pairs of beams. More generally, the selection
rules of the Raman transition allow for transitions between other
states, depending on the polarisation of the light. The allowed
transitions between the different Zeeman states are presented
in~\TableRef{tab:raman_trans}. The laser polarisation
configurations are given in~\TableRef{tab:raman_pol_config}. These
are defined for an atom being excited from \(\ket{F=1}\) and
stimulated into \(\ket{F=2}\), so that the \(\vec{k}_2\) beam
\textit{decreases} the angular momentum when it drives a \(\sigma^+\)
transition. 
\par\noindent
\FigureRef{fig:raman_spectrum} shows an example of the Raman
transition spectrum. The beat frequency
between the two Raman lasers is scanned and the light is pulsed for
\sivalue{160}{\micro\second} to drive atoms into the \(\ket{F=2}\)
state. There is a large peak close to the hyperfine splitting
frequency. This peak is a result of Doppler-insensitive co-propagating
transitions\footnote{When the two light fields are co-propagating, the
  Doppler resonance term \(\delta_\text{D} \propto \vec{k}_1 -
\vec{k}_2\) is close to zero}. This indicates that the two Raman beams
are not orthogonally circularly polarised, as that cannot drive co-propagating
transitions. This is further supported by the fact
that there are \(\Delta m = \pm 1\) transitions, which can only occur
if one of the lasers drives a \(\pi\) transition. The Zeeman shift on
the co-propagating transitions between \(\ket{F=1,0}
\rightarrow \ket{F=2,1}\) and \(\ket{F=1,1}\rightarrow \ket{F=2,1}\)
are \sivalue{95}{\kilo\hertz} and \sivalue{189.5}{\kilo\hertz}, which
correspond to a bias field of \sivalue{1.35}{\gauss}.

Each co-propagating transition from \(\ket{1,0}\) has two smaller

The central peak is shown in more detail
in~\FigureRef{fig:raman_spectrum_inset}. The counter-propagating
transitions are shifted by \sivalue{-185}{\kilo\hertz} and
\(+\)\sivalue{215}{\kilo\hertz} respectively, which correspond to
velocities of \sivalue{7.2}{\centi\metre\per\second} and
\sivalue{8.4}{\centi\metre\per\second}. The same Doppler shifts are also
observed in the peaks corresponding to the \(\ket{F=1,m_F = 0}
\rightarrow \ket{F=2,m_F=\pm 1}\) transitions. The counter-propagating transitions are
Doppler-broadened by the thermal velocity of the atoms along the direction
of the Raman beams. Fitting the transition to the lineshape expected
from a thermal distribution of atoms gives a temperature of
\sivalue{15}{\micro\kelvin} and \sivalue{13.5}{\micro\kelvin} from
each counter-propagating transition. At the time this spectrum was

\subsection{Cancelling the Differential ac Stark
Shift}\label{subsec:light_shift}
It is worth considering the effects of ac Stark shifts on the atom
interferometer. Firstly, they are intrinsically related to the
effective Rabi frequency and as such, cannot be avoided. The average
ac Stark shift \(\Omega^\text{ac}_\text{avg} = (\Omega_1^\text{ac} +
\Omega_2^\text{ac})/2 \) (see~\SectionRef{sec:theory_raman} for more
details) is
the same along both paths of the interferometer, provided that the
intensity variation of the Raman beams over the path separation can be
neglected. Therefore, this should not lead to an observable phase
shift.
\par\noindent
On the other hand, the differential ac Stark shift \(\delta^\text{ac}
= \Omega_1^\text{ac} - \Omega_2^\text{ac}\) can lead to an observable
phase shift. Using the results from Ref.~\cite{Weiss1994} for \(\pi\)
and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) pulses, the phase shift to a Mach-Zender type
interferometer is
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \Phi^\text{ac} =
  \frac{\delta_3^\text{ac}}{\Omega_\text{eff}} - \frac{\delta_1^\text{ac}}{\Omega_\text{eff}} 
 \label{eq:diff_phase}
\end{equation}
where \(\delta_3^\text{ac}\) and \(\delta_1^\text{ac}\) are the ac
Stark shifts of the last and first \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) pulses,
respectively. Therefore, the interferometer is sensitive to the
difference in the ac Stark shift of these pulses. 
\par\noindent
As the atoms fall
under gravity, it is likely that the intensity of the Raman beams
during these pulses will not be the same. Fortunately, it is possible
to eliminate this differential phase shift using an appropriate choice
of intensity and detuning of the Raman lasers. This can be seen by
first writing out the differential ac Stark shift
\begin{equation}
  \delta^\text{ac} = \Omega_1^\text{ac} - \Omega_2^\text{ac} = \sum_{k}
  \frac{\lvert\Omega_{1k}\rvert^2}{4\Delta_{1k}} - \sum_{k}
  \frac{\lvert\Omega_{2k}\rvert^2}{4\Delta_{2k}} 
  \label{eq:diff_shift}
\end{equation}
in terms of the one-photon Rabi frequencies \(\Omega_{ik}\) and
detunings \(\Delta_{ik}\). When both Raman beams are red-detuned from
all the one-photon transitions, both terms
in~\EquationRef{eq:diff_shift} are strictly negative. Therefore,
\(\delta^\text{ac}\) can be cancelled by choosing the correct
intensities for each Raman beam. A plot of \(\delta^{\text{ac}}\)
for various Raman beam intensities as a function of the ratio between
the two Raman beams is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:light_shift_ratio}. There
is a ratio at which the differential ac Stark shift cancels and is
independent of the total intensity. The ratio that cancels
\(\delta^\text{ac}\) for increasing two-photon detuning \(\Delta_R\) is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:light_shift_detuning}. When \(\Delta_R\) is
\sivalue{1.13}{\giga\hertz} below the \trans{2}{3} transition, this
ratio is maximised. The differential ac Stark shift is cancelled when
the intensity ratio of light driving \(\ket{1,0}\) transitions to
\(\ket{2,0}\) transitions is \(\mathcal{R} = 0.583\).

\(\mathcal{R}\) between the light which drives transitions from
\(\ket{1,0}\) to the light that couples to \(\ket{2,0}\) for the
two-photon detuning of \(\Delta_R = -\sivalue{1.13}{\giga\hertz}\)
used in the experiment. Example
intensities for the \(\ket{2,0}\) light are
\sivalue{100}{\watt\per\metre\squared} (blue),
\sivalue{200}{\watt\per\metre\squared} (orange) and
\sivalue{300}{\watt\per\metre\squared} (green). \textbf{(b)} shows how
the ratio for which \(\delta^\text{ac} = 0\) varies as \(\Delta_R\)
increases. The dashed lines indicate the value of \(\Delta_R\) used in
the experiment and its corresponding ratio of 0.583.}
	\label{fig:light_shift_plots}
\end{figure}
\par\noindent
Since it is not straight-forward to directly measure the intensity of
each Raman beam on the atoms, a better method to cancel the
differential ac Stark shift is to use the transition spectrum to
determine when the intensity of the lasers are set to the appropriate
ratio. Experimentally, this was done by adjusting the power of the
pump lasers for the master and slave Solstis lasers. When the master
is seeded with \sivalue{10}{\watt} and the slave with
\sivalue{6.5}{\watt}, the differential ac Stark shift is eliminated.
\FigureRef{fig:cancelled_light_shift} shows the transition spectrum using two different effective Rabi
frequencies, corresponding to \(\pi\) pulse times of
\sivalue{22.5}{\micro\second} and
\sivalue{45}{\micro\second}. In this instance, the frequency difference of the two
co-propagating peaks is less than \sivalue{1}{\kilo\hertz}.

  time of \sivalue{22.5}{\micro\second}
(\sivalue{45}{\micro\second}).}
  \label{fig:cancelled_light_shift}
\end{figure}
There is also a shift of \sivalue{1.4}{\mega\hertz} from
\(f_\text{hfs}\).
This is a result of a
second-order Zeeman shift and corresponds to a field strength of
\sivalue{1.56}{\gauss}.
\subsection{Velocity-Selective Pulse}\label{subsec:vel_select}

The Raman transition is Doppler-sensitive, so the velocity spread of atoms 
contributes to their dynamics. At a temperature of \sivalue{6}{\micro\kelvin}, the Doppler
width is \(\sigma_f = \frac{2}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{k_b T}{m}}
\approx\) \sivalue{60}{\kilo\hertz}. Coherent control of the atomic
state during the interferometer requires that the linewidth of the Raman
transition must be much broader than the Doppler width. This ensures
that each atom is driven at approximately the same Rabi frequency,
reducing the dephasing rate of the atomic coherence. The linewidth of
a Raman transition is determined solely by the pulse intensity and
duration. A pulse duration of \sivalue{7}{\micro\second} has a
linewidth close
to the Doppler width, but the intensities required for this are above
what is attainable with our Raman laser. 
\par\noindent
It is possible to reduce the Doppler width of the participating atoms
by first applying a Raman pulse to select a subset of the population
with a narrower velocity spread~\cite{Moler1992}. This
velocity-selective pulse has a narrower linewidth than the subsequent
interferometer pulses. This ensures that the
Doppler width of atoms in the interferometer is small compared with
the Raman transition linewidth. 
\par\noindent 
Starting with a velocity distribution of atoms
described by a 1-D Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution all occupying the
\(\ket{1,0}\) state, the
population in \(\ket{2,0}\) after applying a Raman pulse is
distributed according to
\begin{equation}
  P_{\ket{2,0}}(v) = \frac{\Omega_\textnormal{eff}^2}{\Omega_\textnormal{eff}^2 + \delta^2}
  \sin\left(\sqrt{\Omega_\textnormal{eff}^2+\delta^2}\;\tau\right)^2 p(v)
  \label{eq:vel_selected_dist}
\end{equation}
where \(\delta\) is the Raman detuning defined
in~\EquationRef{eq:raman_detuning}, \(p(v) = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi
k_B T}} e^{-\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T}}\) is the velocity distribution and
\(\Omega_\textnormal{eff}\) is the effective Rabi frequency defined
in~\EquationRef{eq:rabi_raman_sum}. \FigureRef{fig:vel_selected_dist}
shows a simulation of the
distribution of atoms driven by a $\pi$ pulse with a duration of
\sivalue{40}{\micro\second} and a temperature of
\sivalue{6}{\micro\kelvin}.
The population that is stimulated
has a mean velocity shifted by twice the recoil velocity. In this
instance, the rms
frequency is \(\sigma_f
=\)\sivalue{19.7}{\kilo\hertz}.
\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{vel_selected_dist.pdf}
  \caption[Simulated velocity distribution after a Raman $\pi$ pulse.]{Velocity distribution of a \sivalue{6}{\micro\kelvin}
  ensemble of atoms after a \sivalue{40}{\micro\second} Raman \(\pi\)
pulse. The mean velocity of the stimulated distribution, shown in
orange, is increased due to the recoil during the transition.}
  \label{fig:vel_selected_dist}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Velocity-Selected Distribution}
The velocity distribution of atoms after the velocity selective pulse
can be measured using a second Raman pulse as a probe. In contrast to
the interferometer pulses, this probe must be much lower power than
the velocity-selective pulse so that its linewidth is comparatively narrow.
A measurement of the velocity distribution of the atoms is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:vel_select_chirp}. An initial
\sivalue{40}{\micro\second} \(\pi\) pulse with a Raman beat frequency
\(f_v = \) \sivalue{6834.51}{\mega\hertz} prepares atoms in
\(\ket{1,0}\), before blowing away the atoms which remain in
\(\ket{F=2}\). After \sivalue{10}{\milli\second}, a
\sivalue{80}{\micro\second} \(\pi\) pulse transfers some of the
remaining population back into \(\ket{2,0}\). The frequency of the
probe pulse is varied by chirping the Raman laser beat frequency. In
this instance, the power of the pulse was not tuned to give a \(\pi\)
pulse area so the measured population is not indicative of the maximum
driven by the Raman transition. It is clear that the velocity
distribution of the selected atoms is narrower than the initial
thermal distribution. Fitting to a 1D Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
gives an effective temperature of around \sivalue{1}{\micro\K}.

  applying a narrow pulse at a frequency \(f_{R}\). The population
measured in \(\ket{F=2}\) is shown in blue. The red dashed line is a
fit to a 1D Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the Doppler-broadened
transition peak. For comparison, the
transition spectrum of a single \(\tau = \)\sivalue{40}{\micro\s} \(\pi\)
pulse is shown in orange.}
  \label{fig:vel_select_chirp}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Interferometer Pulses}\label{subsec:int_pulses}
The atoms are coherently controlled by pulsing the Raman
light to drive Rabi oscillations between the two m\(_F = 0\)
hyperfine ground states. The appropriate pulses areas were empirically
determined by observing Rabi oscillations at the corresponding time
for each interferometer pulse. These are shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:rabi_oscillation}. The power in each Raman laser was
set so that a \(\pi\) pulse was achieved with a pulse duration of
\(\tau = \)\sivalue{15}{\micro\s}. It is clear that the oscillations
are rapidly damped. Furthermore, this dephasing rate depends on the
time at which the pulse is applied. Since the atoms are at different
positions in the beam, this suggests that the dephasing is caused by a
spatial variation of the Rabi frequency. This is largely a result of
irregularities in the Raman beam wavefront from defects in
the aspheric lenses. The Gaussian intensity distribution of each beam
is unlikely to cause such a fast dephasing, since the atoms remain
close to the centre of the beams.

\section{Sensitivity}\label{sec:atomint_sensitivity}
This section presents a discussion of some of the major sources of
noise in the interferometer.
\subsection{The Allan Variance}\label{subsec:allan_variance}
For the purposes of this experiment, the sensitivity of the
interferometer relates to the minimum value of uncertainty that can be
placed on a measurement of acceleration. As such, the limit to the
sensitivity is given by the measurement noise. One possible way to
characterise this is to use the variance. However with a finite sequence
of measurements, this depends on the number of samples and might not
converge as the number of samples increases. On the other hand, the
two-sample variance 
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_a^2(2,\tau) = \frac{1}{2}\left\langle
  (a_{n+1}-a_n)^2\right\rangle
  \label{eq:two_sample_var}
\end{equation}
does not depend on the number of samples. This can be generalized to
longer time separations \(t = N \tau\) by taking the mean of \(N\)
consecutive measurements
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_a^2(2,t) = \frac{1}{2}
  \left\langle
  \left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}a_{n+1}-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=N}^{2N-1}a_n\right)^2\right\rangle
  \label{eq:allan_var_mean}
\end{equation}
which is referred to as the Allan variance~\cite{Allan1966}. If the noise in each measurement is uncorrelated, then this becomes
\begin{equation}
\sigma_a(2,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sigma_a(2,\tau)
\label{eq:allan_var_simp}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
The variance is also related to the signal-to-noise ratio of the
observed interferometer fringes. From the interferometer signal
defined in~\EquationRef{eq:interferometer_phase}, the variance at the
mid-point of the fringe \(\Delta \phi = \pi/2\) is given by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_P^2 = \sigma_{\text{P}_0}^2 +\frac{C^2}{4}
  \sigma_{\Delta \phi}^2
  \label{eq:var_expansion}
\end{equation}
The signal-to-noise ratio
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{S}{N}\right) = \frac{C}{2\sigma_P}
  \label{eq:snr}
\end{equation}
is the ratio of the fringe amplitude to the standard deviation of the
interferometer signal. Under the assumption that \(\text{P}_0\) and
\(C\) do not fluctuate, the signal-to-noise ratio is related to the
interferometer phase and acceleration uncertainties by
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^{-1} = \sigma_{\Delta \phi} = \keff T^2 \sigma_a
  \label{eq:snr_acc}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Sources of Noise}
Some potential sources of noise have been investigated to determine
their magnitude. These are not a complete list of the effects which
reduce the sensitivity to accelerations, but are the most dominant. The
identified sources and their estimated effects on acceleration
measurements are shown in~\TableRef{tab:noise_sources}. The largest
contributor comes from vibrations of the retro-reflecting mirror.
Other noise sources, such as magnetic field gradients, laser intensity
noise and rotations have not yet been characterised.
\begin{table}[htpb!]

  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}

pulse time of \(\tau = \)\sivalue{20}{\micro\s}.}
  \label{tab:noise_sources}
\end{table}
\subsection{Detection Noise}\label{subsec:detection_noise}

Each measurement of the number of atoms has an uncertainty due to
random processes that influence the voltage measured by the detector. These errors
combine to give an uncertainty in the interferometer phase and
hence, acceleration. It is worth distinguishing between the different
sources of noise in measuring the number of atoms. Uncertainties due
to fluctuations in the number of atoms and detected photons per
measurement cannot be reduced below their shot-noise levels. In
particular, the phase noise corresponding to the atom shot noise is
the minimum value attainable. Therefore, it is essential that the
photo-detector used is sensitive enough to ensure that this does not
limit the sensitivity~\cite{Rocco2014}.
\subsubsection{Atom and Photon Shot Noise}
The discrete nature and the fact that atoms are loaded into the
experiment and scatter photons at a constant rate mean that the
statistics on the number of atoms and photons are well-described by
Poisson distributions. It follows that the number of atoms in the
interferometer as well as the number of photons arriving at the detector during
each measurement have
shot noise fluctuations. From~\EquationRef{eq:pd_signal}, these are related to an
equivalent output voltage as follows
\begin{align}
  \sigma_\text{at,v}^2 &= \alpha^2 \eta^2 R_\text{sc}^2 n_\text{at}\\
  \sigma_\text{p,v}^2 &= \alpha^2 \eta R_\text{sc} n_\text{at} 
  \label{eq:atom_photon_noise}
\end{align}
where \(\sigma_\text{at,v}\) dominates, provided at least one photon
per atom is detected. Hereafter, no attention will be paid to the
photon shot noise. For the detection parameters previously defined,
the shot noise is equal to around \sivalue{46.5}{\nano\volt} per atom. 
\par\noindent
In order for the uncertainty in the atom number to
be dominated by the atom shot noise, the detector must be sensitive
enough that it has a \ac{nep} much lower than the noise in the optical
power detected. The \ac{nep} of a detector is defined as the
equivalent optical power which gives a signal-to-noise ratio of 0
after an integration time of \sivalue{0.5}{\second}. It is convenient
to express this as a voltage density, by multiplying it by the
photodiode gain. Hence, the
voltage density of a detector whose sensitivity is at the atom shot noise
level for an integration time \(tau_D\) is given by
\begin{equation}
  V_\text{at} = \frac{\sigma_\text{at,v}}{\sqrt{1/2\tau_D}}
  \label{eq:nep}
\end{equation}. 

%In the time domain, the signal is convolved with a rectangular pulse
%of a characteristic time \(\tau\), so the power spectral density is a
%product of the individual power spectral densities
%\begin{equation}
%  S(f) = 2 S_0\left(\frac{\sin(\pi f \tau)}{\pi f \tau}\right)^2
%  \label{eq:psd_shot_conf}
%\end{equation}
%where \(S_0\) is the one-sided power spectral density of the shot
%noise component. From the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, the variance is
%equal to the integral of the power spectral density, so
%\begin{equation}
%  S_0 = \sigma^2_\text{i,v} \tau
%  \label{eq:shot_noise_amp}
%\end{equation}
%For shorter detection times, this has the effect of aliasing
%high-frequency noise into the lower-frequency components.  
%The number of photons
%arriving at the detector in a time interval \(\Delta t\) is given by
%\begin{align}
%  n_p &= N R_\text{sc}(I,\Delta) \eta \delta t \nonumber\\
%  &= \alpha N
%  \label{eq:photon_detector}
%\end{align}
%where \(\eta\) is the collection efficiency of the detector, \(N\) is
%the number of atoms and \(R_\text{sc}\) is the scattering rate defined
%in \EquationRef{eq:scattering_rate}. The atom shot noise and photon
%shot noise are given by \(\sigma_N = \sqrt{N}\) and \(\sigma_p =
%\sqrt{n_p}\), respectively. The
%uncertainty in the number of detected photons \(\sigma_D\) has
%contributions from both the atom shot noise and the photon shot noise
%\begin{equation}
%  \sigma_D = \sqrt{\alpha^2\sigma_N^2 + \sigma_p^2} 
%  \label{eq:detection_uncertainty}
%\end{equation}
%This is dominated by the atom shot noise when \(\alpha^2 > 1\), i.e. when
%more than one photon per atom is detected by the photodiode. 
%\par\noindent
%There is additional contribution to \(\sigma_D\) from the technical
%noise of the detector. The signal from the photodiode is averaged over
%the detection time \(\Delta t\), so the variance in this is given by
%\begin{equation}
%  \sigma_v = \int_0^{f_c} |S_\text{pd}|^2 \mathrm{d}f 
%  \label{eq:photodiode_noise_bandwidth}
%\end{equation}
%where \(|S_\text{pd}|^2\) is the one-sided power spectral density of the
%photodiode signal and \(f_c = 1/(2\Delta t)\) is the frequency
%bandwidth.   
\subsubsection{Photodiode Technical Noise}
Technical noise in the detector typically arises from multiple electronic processes -- such as Johnson noise and shot noise in
the current -- but it is not necessary to consider them independently
in the following discussion. The technical noise of the detector can
be estimated by measuring the output voltage when no light is
collected. A plot of the power spectral density of the photodiode is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:pd_psd} taken
with a sampling frequency of \sivalue{200}{\kilo\hertz}. The
photodiode was covered and the output voltage was sampled for
\sivalue{2}{\second}. The power spectral density has been calculated
using Welch's method~\cite{Welch1967}. The data are partitioned before
calculating the Fourier transform of each subset and taking the
average. This has the effect of reducing the variance in the estimated
power spectrum at the expense of reducing the frequency resolution.
Below \sivalue{10}{\kilo\hertz} the power spectral density is close
to uniform with a value of around
\sivalue{5e-13}{\volt\squared\per\hertz}, which corresponds to a
noise-equivalent power of \sivalue{391}{\femto\W\per\hertz\tothe{1/2}}.
For higher frequencies, the power spectral density starts to
increase. The plot also indicates the corresponding voltage noise
density to reach the
atom shot noise limit for atom numbers of 
of n\(_\text{at} =\) \num{5e6} and \num{1e6} with the previously
defined output voltage per atom. 
\begin{figure}[htpb!]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{noise_source_psd}
  \caption[Photodiode power spectral density]{Power spectral density of the photodiode output voltage

the required voltage noise density to equal the atom shot noise level
after integrating for \(\tau = 2/f\)\sivalue{}{\s} for atom numbers of
\num{5e6} and \num{1e6}, respectively.}
  \label{fig:noise_source_psd}
\end{figure}
Averaging the detection signal over a time \(\tau\) has the effect of
filtering the signal above the Nyquist frequency \(f_n = 1/(2 \tau)\).
The variance in the averaged voltage over successive shots
i.e. the Allan variance, is related to the power spectral density as
follows
\begin{equation}
  \sigma^2_\text{av}(\tau) = 2 \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(\pi \tau f)^4}{(\pi \tau f)^2}S(f)\;\mathrm{d}\;f
  \label{eq:av_psd}
\end{equation}
Using~\EquationRef{eq:av_psd}, it is possible to determine the
detection time required to reduce the shot-to-shot variance below the
atom shot noise level. A plot of the Allan deviation for increasing
integration time is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:detection_av}, along with the rms voltage expected
for the same numbers of atoms used
in~\FigureRef{fig:noise_source_psd}. At the integration time of
\sivalue{200}{\micro\second}, the detector noise
is close to \sivalue{5}{\micro\volt} -- well below the level of the
atom shot noise.

experiment.}

%\subsection{Atom Shot Noise}

%subsection{Detection Noise}

\subsection{The Sensitivity Function}
The sources of noise presented thus far arise from statistical
uncertainties in measuring the number of atoms and are not present in
the ideal case of perfect interferometer contrast. However, there are
still other sources which introduce interferometer phase noise. Generally speaking, these add a random component to
the interferometer phase which is independent of the forces acting on
the atoms. Two dominant sources of phase noise are vibrations of the
retro-reflecting mirror and laser phase noise, i.e. fluctuations in
the relative phase between the two Raman light fields.
\par\noindent
The sensitivity function~\cite{Dick1987}
defines the instantaneous shift of the
interferometer phase \(\delta\Phi\) at a time \(t\) due to a phase
shift of the Raman laser phase \(\delta \phi\)
\begin{equation}
  g(t) = \lim_{\delta\phi \rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta\Phi(\delta \phi,
  t)}{\delta(\phi)}
  \label{eq:sensitivity_def}
\end{equation}
so the interferometer phase shift induced by fluctuations of
\(\phi\) is given by
\begin{align}
  \Phi &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t)\delta \phi\;\mathrm{d}\phi(t)
  \nonumber\\
  &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t)\;\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d} t}\;
  \mathrm{d}t
  \label{eq:phase_contrib}
\end{align}
In the case of a \(\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2\) interferometer pulse sequence of
durations \(\tau_R-2 \tau_R - \tau_R\) and where \(t=0\) is defined at
the centre of the \(\pi\) pulse, the sensitivity function is 
\begin{equation}
    g(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
      \sin ( \Omega t) & 0<t<\tau_R  \\
      1 & \tau_R <t<\tau_R +T \\
      \sin (\Omega  (t-T)) & \tau_R +T<t<2 \tau_R +T
  \end{cases}
\label{eq:sensitivity_interferometer}
\end{equation}
for a pulse separation time \(T\). 
\subsection{Influence of Laser Phase Noise}
The response of the interferometer phase to laser phase noise is
best understood in the frequency domain. In particular, the inverse
of the interferometer pulse separation time 
The effects of \(\phi\) are best
thought of in terms of its Fourier components. Writing \(\phi(t) = A
\cos(\omega t + \psi)\), \EquationRef{eq:phase_contrib} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \Phi = - A \omega \cos(\psi) \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t) \sin(\omega
  t) \mathrm{d} t
  \label{eq:phase_fourier}
\end{equation}
where the term proportional to \(\cos(\omega t)\) has been dropped,
since \(g(t)\) is an odd function. The integrand
in~\EquationRef{eq:phase_fourier} is proportional to the Fourier
transform of \(g(t)\)
\begin{equation}
  G(\omega) = -i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(t) \sin(\omega t)
  \mathrm{d} t
  \label{eq:sensitvity_fourier}
\end{equation}
which using~\EquationRef{eq:sensitivity_interferometer}
becomes~\cite{Canuel2007}
\begin{equation}
  G(\omega) = \frac{4 i
  \Omega}{\omega^2-\Omega^2}\sin\left(\frac{\omega(T+2\tau)}{2}\right)\left(\cos\left(\frac{\omega(T+2\tau)}{2}\right)
  + \frac{\omega T}{2}\sin \left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right)\right)
  \label{eq:sens_fourier_full}
\end{equation}
so~\EquationRef{eq:phase_contrib} becomes
\begin{align}
  \Phi &= -i A \cos(\psi) \;\omega G(\omega) \nonumber \\
  &= - A \cos(\psi) \lvert H(\omega)\rvert
  \label{eq:interfometer_fourier}
\end{align}
\par\noindent
A plot of the transfer function \(|H(\omega)|^2\) is presented
in~\FigureRef{fig:transfer_function} for
\(T= \)\sivalue{20}{\milli\second} and \(\tau
= \)\sivalue{20}{\micro\second}. The asymptotic properties of the
transfer function can be summarised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item At low frequencies \(\omega \ll \Omega\), the transfer
    function is approximated by 
    \begin{equation}
      |H(\omega)|^2 \approx 16 \sin \left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right)^4
    \end{equation}
    which is a periodic function that is zero at frequency multiples
    of \(1/\pi T\) \\
  \item At frequencies \(\omega \gg \Omega\), the transfer function is
    \begin{equation}
      |H(\omega)|^2 \approx 4 \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}\sin
      \left(\omega T\right)^2
    \end{equation}
    which is zero at multiples of \(1/2\pi T\) and is a low-pass
    first-order filter.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htpb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{transfer_func_laser.pdf}
  \caption[Transfer function for laser phase noise.]{Transfer function
  for laser phase noise. Here, the separation between pulses is \(T =
  \)\sivalue{20}{\milli\second} and the \(\pi/2\) pulse time is \(\tau
=\)\sivalue{20}{\micro\second}.}
  \label{fig:transfer_function}
\end{figure}
\par\noindent
The variance of \(\Phi\) is obtained by averaging over \(\psi\)
\begin{equation} 
  \sigma_\Phi^2 = \langle \Phi^2\rangle_\psi = \frac{1}{2} A^2
  |H(\omega)|^2
  \label{eq:var_phi_transfer}
\end{equation} which is related to the phase noise power spectral density
\(S_\phi(\omega)\) by
  \begin{equation}
    \sigma_\Phi^2 = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty
    S_\Phi(\omega)|H(\omega)|^2 \frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{2\pi} =
      \int_0^\infty
    S_\Phi(\omega)|H(\omega)|^2 \frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{2\pi} 
    \label{eq:phase_noise_psd}
  \end{equation}
Similarly, the Allan variance can be expressed using the transfer
function and the phase noise power spectral density~\cite{Gouet2008}.
The integration time \(\tau_\text{av} = m T_c\) is expressed in multiples
of the experiment cycling time \(T_c\). In the frequency domain, the phase
noise power spectral density is sampled at frequency multiples of
\(f_c = 1/T_c\), so the Allan variance becomes
\begin{equation}
  \sigma^2_\Phi(\tau_\text{av}) = \frac{1}{\tau_\text{av}}
    \sum_{k=1}^\infty |H(2\pi k f_c|)^2S_\phi(2\pi k f_c)
  \label{eq:avar_transfer}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
The laser phase noise originates from the reference oscillator used in
the phase-locked loop for the M-Squared laser. The phase noise
spectral density and corresponding Allan deviation for increasing
integration time was measured by M-Squared during installation of the
laser system. A plot of the Allan deviation is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:allan_dev_m_squared}. At an interferometer pulse
separation of
\(T = \)\sivalue{25}{\milli\second}, the phase noise in the Raman
laser results in an uncertainty in the interferometer phase of
\sivalue{10}{\milli\radian}. 
\begin{figure}[htpb!]

  \label{fig:allan_dev_m2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Vibrations}
The phase difference between the two Raman beams depends on the
position of the retro-reflecting mirror. Consequently, this defines a frame of
reference for the position of the atoms during the interferometer. Any
random motion of the mirror, for instance from mechanical vibrations,
introduces a random component to the laser phase. An acceleration of
the mirror modifies the laser phase as follows
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \Phi(t)}{\mathrm{d} t^2} = \keff.\textbf{a}(t)
  \label{eq:phase_acc}
\end{equation}
and the sensitivity to accelerations \(g_a\) is given by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{k_\text{eff}} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 g_a(t)}{\mathrm{d} t^2} =
  g(t) \\
  \label{eq:acc_sens}
\end{equation}
Assuming that the pulse time \(\tau\) is much shorter than the
interferometer pulse separation, \(T\), the acceleration sensitivity
function is approximated by
\begin{equation}
  g_a(t) = \begin{cases}
 -1 & - T < t < 0\\
 1 & 0 < t < T
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:acc_sens_approx}
\end{equation}
From this, the acceleration transfer function is
\begin{equation}
  |H_a(\omega)|^2 = \frac{k_\text{eff}^2}{\omega^2}|H(\omega)|^2 
  \label{eq:acc_transfer}
\end{equation}
which in the low frequency limit \(\omega \ll \Omega\) is
\begin{equation}
  |H_a(\omega)|^2 = \frac{16 k_\text{eff}^2}{\omega^4}
  \sin\left(\frac{\omega T}{2}\right)^4
  \label{eq:acc_tf_low}
\end{equation}
Equivalent definitions for the variance and Allan variance are
obtained using this and the acceleration noise spectral density
\(S_a(2\pi f)\) as the respective definitions
in~\EquationRef{eq:phase_noise_psd}
and~\EquationRef{eq:avar_transfer}. The transfer function for
acceleration noise is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:transfer_func_acc}. The
gain is largest at low frequencies and approximates a second-order
filter at higher frequencies.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{transfer_func_acc}
  \caption[Acceleration noise transfer function.]{Acceleration noise
  transfer function. The parameters used here are the same as those
previously defined for~\FigureRef{fig:transfer_function}.}
  \label{fig:transfer_func_acc}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Measuring the Acceleration Noise Power Spectral Density}
The interferometer phase is most sensitive to low-frequency
vibrations. Acceleration noise at frequencies greater than \(1/2T\)
will mostly average out, contributing little to an overall phase.
Precise measurements of the interferometer phase rely on reducing the
low frequency noise. The vibration of the retro-reflecting mirror is
reduced by passively isolated it from its environment. The
chamber is mounted on a layer of Sorbothane to dissipate the
vibrations from the ground. This isolation is enhanced by a
pneumatic suspension system between the optical table and its
supporting legs. 
\par\noindent
A comparison of the acceleration noise spectral density with and
without the pneumatic suspension, measured using
the accelerometer mounted behind the retro-reflecting mirror, is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:vibration_spectrum}. The suspension acts as a
low-pass filter and reduces the power within the
10-\sivalue{200}{\hertz} bandwidth, which is aliased into the lower
frequency band. For an interferometer pulse separation of \(T =
\)\sivalue{25}{\ms}, the
vibration phase noise using~\EquationRef{eq:avar_transfer} is \(\sigma_\Phi = \)\sivalue{270}{\milli\radian}. Without
floating the table, this becomes \sivalue{7}{\radian}. With the
vibration isolation systems currently used, this remains the dominant
source of phase noise. More sophisticated methods of damping
low-frequency vibrations are required to improve the interferometer's
acceleration sensitivity.

power spectral density using pneumatic suspension to decrease the
coupling of vibrations from the ground to the experiment. For
comparison, the blue curve shows the power spectral density without
this isolation.}

%\subsection{Other Sources of Phase Noise}
%Aside from laser phase noise and vibrations, there are additional effects
%which result in interferometer phase noise. These have not been
%characterised in this experiment as their magnitude is typically much
%smaller than the present vibration phase noise. 
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \underline{Magnetic field gradients}. The \(\Delta_m = 0\)
%    clock transition has a second-order Zeeman shift of
%    \sivalue{575}{\Hz\gauss\tothe{-2}}. A gradient of magnetic field
%    across the area traversed by the atoms introduces a propagation

\section{Measuring Accelerations}\label{sec:atomint_accelerations}

\subsection{Fringe Calibration}\label{sec:fringe_cal}
Without perfect fringe visibility, the interferometer signal must
first be calibrated to infer the phase difference. This is done by
varying the phase difference between the two Raman lasers for the
middle \(\pi\) pulse. Since the interferometer phase is \(\Delta \Phi = \phi_1 - 2\phi_2
+\phi_3\), varying \(\phi_2\) induces the largest change in
\(\Delta\Phi\). An interference fringe obtained in this
manner is shown in~\FigureRef{fig:fringe_examp}.
In this instance, the contrast is \(C = 0.055\) and the mean
probability of detecting in \(\ket{F=2}\) is \(\textnormal{P}_0 =
0.39\). 
Fringe fitting described in~\cite{Peters2001}

    difference of the two Raman lasers during the middle \(\pi\) pulse

curve is a non-linear least squares fit to the data, giving a contrast
of \(C = 0.055\) and a mean value of \(\textnormal{P}_0 = 0.39\). The
shaded region indicates the 95\% confidence band. }
  \label{fig:fringe_examp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Correcting for Vibration Noise}\label{sec:vibration_senstivity}
Vibrations of the retro-reflecting mirror are a significant source of
phase noise, which limits the sensitivity of the interferometer to
accelerations. This is particularly apparent when the vibration noise
induces a phase shift of greater than 2\(\pi\) radians. If the
interferometer signal spans multiple fringes, it is not possible to
accurately determine acceleration from the phase shift.
\par\noindent
One method to filter the effects of vibration noise, described in
~\cite{Merlet2009}, uses the MEMS accelerometer to measure the
vibration of the retro-reflecting mirror between the
first and last interferometer pulse. After this time, the phase shift
due to vibrations is given by the following convolution
\begin{equation}
  \phi_\textnormal{vib} = K \int_{-T}^{T} g_a (t) V(t) \mathrm{d}t = K
  \widetilde{V}_\textnormal{vib}
  \label{eq:phase_vib}
\end{equation}
where \(V(t)\) is the voltage measured across the output of the MEMS
accelerometer, \(K = \)\sivalue{0.793}{\m\s\tothe{2}\per\V} is the
scaling factor from voltage to acceleration and \(g_a(t)\) is the
acceleration sensitivity function, defined
in~\EquationRef{eq:acc_sens_approx}. The interferometer signal is then
fit to the function
\begin{equation}
  \text{P}_{\ket{F=2}} = \text{P}_0 + \frac{C}{2}\sin(\alpha
  \widetilde{V}_\textnormal{vib} + \phi_0)
  \label{eq:fringe_fit_vibration}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
Common-mode suppression of the vibration phase noise is achieved by
estimating the interferometer phase from the residuals of the fit
to~\EquationRef{eq:fringe_fit_vibration}. If the interferometer phase
as estimated from~\EquationRef{eq:interferometer_phase} is denoted
\(\phi_\textnormal{int}\), then the fit residuals are
\(\phi_\textnormal{res} =  \phi_\textnormal{int} -
\phi_\textnormal{vib}\).
The correlation of the acceleration measured by the MEMS accelerometer
and the interferometer signal is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:vib_comparison}. The Raman laser phase difference was
initially set so that the interferometer signal was at the mid-point
of the fringe \(\Delta \phi = \pi/2\) before continuously running the
experiment. The vibration noise was increased
by removing the pneumatic suspension of the optical table, which
helps to passively isolate the experiment from external vibrations
that are coupled through the table legs. Without this additional
suppression, the vibration noise is large enough to shift the
interferometer phase by more than \(2\pi\), as indicated
in~\FigureRef{fig:high_vib}. When the table is suspended, the
vibration noise is small enough that the interferometer signal remains
on one side of the fringe.

    optical table was not pneumatically suspended. \textbf{(b)} shows

  isolation.}
  \label{fig:vib_comparison}
\end{figure}
\par\noindent
The suppression of the vibration noise can be seen in the distribution
of the estimated acceleration. For the data obtained when the
vibrations were more suppressed (\FigureRef{fig:low_vib}), histograms of the acceleration measured
by the MEMS accelerometer and the interferometer are shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:vibration_hists}.

    the distribution after filtering the vibration noise from the
    interferometer signal (green). The dashed lines indicate the
  fitted normal distributions.}
  \label{fig:vibration_hists}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Signal Stability}\label{subsec:stability}	
The stability of the interferometer's sensitivity to accelerations can
be determined from the Allan deviation. A comparison of the
Allan deviation in the presence of high and low vibrations is shown
in~\FigureRef{fig:adev_comparison}. In both instances, the sensitivity
to accelerations is improved by correcting for the vibration-induced
phase. Under high vibration (\FigureRef{fig:high_vib_adev}), the Allan deviation has a minimum value
of around \sivalue{3e-6}{\m\s\tothe{-2}} after integrating for
\sivalue{35}{\s}. This is a bias instability, i.e. fluctuations in
the bias. This value is obtained by subtracting the vibration
phase, estimated from the MEMS accelerometer, from the interferometer
phase. It is possible that noise in the MEMS
accelerometer is contributing to a bias instability.
\par\noindent
When the vibration level is reduced, the signal
remains stable for a longer period of time. Here, the Allan deviation
is proportional to \(\tau^{-1/2}\), which is characteristic of
uncorrelated white phase noise. For longer integration times, the
small number of samples introduces a large uncertainty on the Allan
deviation in~\FigureRef{fig:low_vib_adev}. However, for integration
times up to \sivalue{100}{\s}, 
the sensitivity of the signal is not limited by the same bias
instability as in the presence of larger

    sensitivity after subtracting this.

    the sensitivity in a high vibration environment, and
    \textbf{(b)} shows it after reducing the level of vibration.}
